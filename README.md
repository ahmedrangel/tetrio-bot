# Tetrio-Bot
A Tetris bot capable of automatically playing custom multiplayer matches in TETR.IO. It uses a modified version of [ElTetris](https://github.com/ielashi/eltetris) to analyze the current board for optimal moves and the [@haelp/teto](https://github.com/Genius6942/triangle) library to interact with main game API.

This project can be a good starting point to start developing tetrio bots.

## Demo
The bot is the one on the right side.
